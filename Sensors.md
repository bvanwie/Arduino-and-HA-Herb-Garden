# Sensor Min/Max Readings
This lists the wet abd dry readings of the 5 sensors I have on-hand to do this project.  From there, I'll be able to come up with a min/max in order to compute soil moisture percentage.  Highest wet and lowest dry should be suitable.

| # | Wet | Dry |
| -- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 311 | 582 |
| 2 | 310 | 581 |
| 3 | 308 | 576 |
| 4 | ***314*** | 582 |
| 5 | 306 | ***570*** |
